# PharmaLedger_funding
This repo contains the smart contracts for a blockchain based environment for funding projects and posting projects on a bounty board. It was designed by Team Novartis of the 2022 Blockchain Challenge hosted by the University of Basel.
The system consists of three smart contracts: a basic ERC-20 token used for paying the contracts, a bounty board contract where bounties can be funded by multiple parties and a funding round contest that facilitates the aggregation and distribution of funds. 

Addtionally this repo contains 2 Jupyter notebooks used for calculating the "Danger Zone" maximum(Maximum at which funding above softcap returns more voting power than funding delivered) and testing the deployed contracts.
